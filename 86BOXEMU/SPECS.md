# My platform for retro-computing experiments

## Host

I used my usuall Laptop, A Lenovo T480 with 64GB RAM and i7-8550U running Windows 10 as the host platform. Nothing special, its my everyday platform for daily work. The emulator is [86Box](https://86box.net/), with [WinBox](https://github.com/86Box/WinBox-for-86Box) as a manager. I installed [NpCap](https://npcap.com/), so that I can use the PCap mode network of 86Box. I also have the [ImDisk](http://www.ltr-data.se/opencode.html/#ImDisk) on my host for editing disk images. [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) alway helps. The [Virutal Floppy Image Converter](https://www.vector.co.jp/soft/win95/util/se151106.html) can convert rare format of disk images or extract files from them, mostly from NEC PC-98XX in Japanese.

Nothing else. Ignoring some details, this is my first PC when I was 14. I had my best PC experience on that machine.
