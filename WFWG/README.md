# Interesting notes about Windows For Workgroups 3.11

This also include all versions of Windows 3.xx. I planned this is for that, not only WFWG.

## Loading WFWG directly by IO.SYS

This is tricky, but [possible](IOLOADWFWG.md).

## WFWG's standard mode

This is rarely mentioned, but [exist](STDMODE.md).
