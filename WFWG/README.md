# Interesting notes about Windows For Workgroups 3.11

This also include all versions of Windows 3.xx. I planned this is for that, not only WFWG.

## Loading WFWG directly by IO.SYS

This is tricky, but [possible](IOLOADWFWG.md).

## WFWG's standard mode

This is rarely mentioned, but [exist](STDMODE.md).

## Installing WFWG on PC-DOS 7.1 on a FAT32 partition

Sounds challenging, but [simple in fact](WFWPCDOS71.md).

## WFWG on FreeDOS

WFWG can be run on FreeDOS 1.3. [This is real](FDWFWG.md), not a fake.
