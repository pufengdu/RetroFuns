# W3XSTART.BAT
Loading Windows 3.x in 386 enhanced mode in MS-DOS 7.1 is a very common topic in retro computing. The OSR2FIX patch method is very commonly applied. However, this method modifies IO.SYS, which may have unforeseen side effects. Therefore, I developed in memory patches, as I have already published as a part of [IO8EMMOK](https://github.com/pufengdu/IO8EMMOK) package. When I dig further, I find that the OSR2FIX method can be simplified to modify **only 2 bytes** in the memory before typing WIN. With the help of Douglas Boling's STRINGS.COM, a batch file is enough for the task. See comments in W3XSTART.BAT for details.
